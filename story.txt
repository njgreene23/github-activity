It was late on a Sunday night. Nick had done little with the day, and the homework for the upcoming week was
beginning to stack up. His motivation was week, but after a long nap he managed to work up the mental strength
to get started. Nick and all his roommates congregated in the living room in order to begin the coming week's
assignments. After several hours of working on his laptop, Nick was beginning to grow more and more tired. After
opening the fridge, he could see that he had one Bang left. After a quick chug and a walk to the local Kwik Trip,
he was ready to get started once again.
