It was late on a Sunday night. Nick had done little with the day, and the homework for the upcoming week was
beginning to stack up. His motivation was week, but after a long nap he managed to work up the mental strength
to get started. Nick and all his roommates congregated in the living room in order to begin the coming week's
assignments. After several hours of working on his laptop, Nick was beginning to grow more and more tired. After
opening the fridge, he could see that he had one Bang left. After a quick chug and a walk to the local Kwik Trip,
he was ready to get started once again.

However, as soon as Nick stepped through the door back into his apartment, he could tell that something was off. It
didn't take long for him to realize why. His roommates, who had been gathered working on their homework, weren't
where Nick had left them. A quick search of the rooms told him that they weren't even in the apartment anymore. The
deafening silence hit him like a wall of bricks. Taking a deep break, Nick decided that there must be a logical
explanation for his roommates' disappearance.

Nick tried reaching each of his roommates' cellphones but they were switched off. This was highly unusual. An idea struck him 
then. He tried tracking each of their locations using Snapchat Map. Fortunately, one of his roommates, Kevin's, snap map 
displayed the location of the woods near the picnic point, and the time stamp showed that it was two minutes ago. But knowing 
Kevin, Nick was still not completely convinced that they were okay. Putting his phone back in his pocket, he set off for the 
woods. When he was a few steps from the woods, Nick was able to make out an orange glow in the distance. Upon seeing this, 
he had started putting the pieces together, but he still walked on, if for nothing else then to just satisfy his curiosity. 
What he saw barely came as a surprise to him: his roommates passed out, drunk, around the bonfire.
